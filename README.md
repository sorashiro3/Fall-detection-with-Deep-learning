# Fall-detection-with-Deep-learning
Hello, Learners !!!

This project was created for an event at my college, IIIT Nagpur.

The aim of this project is to contribute to healthcare improvement. 

The model developed here can be deployed on an embedded board worn by patients with low motor reflexes. If the patient falls, the model can detect the fall and send an alert to the respective caretakers, ensuring the patient's safety.

For more detailed information, please refer to the report.

# Important
Please ensure that all files, especially the dataset and notebooks, are placed in the same folder.

It is recommended to read the **"Dataset Info"** file to better understand the dataset. Additionally, reading the report may provide useful insights, though it is optional.

Thank You !!!!!
